# SophiaDL  
**Σοφία (Sophia)** – Greek for "wisdom," represents my journey of gaining knowledge and understanding in deep learning using PyTorch.

## About the Repository  
Welcome to **SophiaDL**, a personal learning project where I explore the fundamentals and advanced concepts of deep learning using PyTorch. This repository will document my progress, experiments, and hands-on projects as I learn to build and optimize neural networks and develop a deeper understanding of AI.

## Goals  
1. Understand the basics of deep learning concepts such as forward and backward propagation, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.  
2. Gain hands-on experience in implementing neural networks using PyTorch.  
3. Explore various architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.  
4. Work on small projects to apply learned concepts to real-world problems.  

## Repository Structure  
This repository will grow and evolve as I progress. Here's a tentative structure:  
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks covering theory and hands-on experiments.  
- **Projects/**: Mini-projects implementing learned concepts.  
- **Resources/**: References and materials that helped me during this journey.  
- **Logs/**: Notes and reflections on my learning process.
